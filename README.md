### Full Stack Developer living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Hello, since I was a child I have always been passionate about games and everything that involved science. Because of this passion at the age of 17, I entered computer science college and had my first contact with programming. At first I didn't do very well in the subject but over time I fell in love always wanting to learn more.

I am currently part of the Programadores Cariocas project, a program run by the city of Rio de Janeiro that seeks young people in economic vulnerability to teach them how to take their first steps in a developer career. Through the program I was able to participate in the full-stack bootcamp (Javascript) at Generation Brazil where I collaborated in the classroom as a monitor and class representative

I'm always in the learning process and on my github you can see my projects and my evolution as a programmer üòÉ
